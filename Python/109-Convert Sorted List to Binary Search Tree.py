@desc:
Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.



Example 1:


Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 4:

Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]


Constraints:

The numner of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 10^4].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

# Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
#
# Example 1:
# Given tree s:
#
#      3
#     / \
#    4   5
#   / \
#  1   2
# Given tree t:
#    4
#   / \
#  1   2
# Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
# Example 2:
# Given tree s:
#
#      3
#     / \
#    4   5
#   / \
#  1   2
#     /
#    0
# Given tree t:
#    4
#   / \
#  1   2
# Return false.
